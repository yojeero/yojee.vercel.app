### Personal site   

A personal portfolio focused on building thoughtful digital products.

This site brings together product engineering and design in a simple, deliberate way. The work emphasizes clarity, usability, and performance—removing noise so ideas can speak for themselves.

Each project reflects a careful balance of structure and detail, from layout and interaction to accessibility and speed. Everything is designed to feel light, responsive, and easy to use.

This is an ongoing practice of making things that work well, age well, and respect the user.
